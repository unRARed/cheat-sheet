Fantasy Football Cheat Sheet
============================

I put together a fantasy football cheat-sheet every year in order to be able
to see value more easily when drafting. This script fetches the .txt files
containing tiers data for 0.5 point PPR from [Boris Chen's
website here](http://www.borischen.co/).

Run `./cheat.rb` and crack a beer. =)
