Fantasy Football Cheat Sheet
============================

I put together a fantasy football cheat-sheet every year in order to be able to
see value more easily when drafting. This script fetches tiers data for 0.5
point PPR from
[Fantasy Pros here](https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/rankings/half-point-ppr-cheatsheets.php).

Step: 1, Run `bundle install` (you'll need ruby)
Step: 2, Run `./cheat.rb`

Step 3, crack a beer and draft. =)
